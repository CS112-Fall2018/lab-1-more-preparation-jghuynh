Lab 1 Worksheet

1. What if 12 bits were used to store a signed integer. What is the biggest/smallest possible integer?
The biggest integer: 2**12 - 1
The smallest integer: -(2**12)

2. Think about possible values and their range, say what type of variable would be suitable for the following, and suggest a name for it too. 

For example: the temperature of a room in degrees Fahrenheit. Room temperature is likely to vary between say 50 degrees F and 100 degrees F,  but it can take any value in between including non-integers, e.g 71.19 F, so the type must be float or double depending on the accuracy required. A suitable variable name would be roomTemp. 


(i) The number of pages in a book;
represented by a short, since some books can have as many as 500 pages. The number of pages is never a float, or a decimal. 
A suitable name would be: pageNumbers

(ii) The number of atoms in a book; 
Since there are lots of atoms in a book, represent that number with a long.
A suitable name would be numAtoms.

(iii) The length of a side of a triangle in inches; 
Since the length of a triangle side can be represented by a decimal, represent the number with a float. The side need not to be 
accurate past 15 significant figures.
A suitable name would be triangeSideLength.

(iv) Your name; 
My name is represented by a char, (character), or a string.
A suitable name for my name: myName.

(v) Whether or not a nucleus has decayed; 
This is a boolean expression. True, the nucleus has decayed, or False: the nucleus is not decayed.
A suitable name for this expression: isNucleusDecayed.

(vi) The probability that it could have decayed.
The probability is usually represented by a decimal number, so represent it with a float. The probability need not to be exact by 15 
significiant figures.
A suitable name for this probability is decayedProbability. 

3. Start to do a little java programming! 
	Follow the example of the Hello.java program and do some testing of Java int and float.
	Write a short class called “Arithmetic” that in its main method does the following:

		Creates 4 local variables
			Two ints (call them a and b)
			Two floats (call them x and y)
		Performs the following arithmetic operations on every combination of two of these 
		and output using System.out.println each of the results
			Addition
			Division (in both directions)
